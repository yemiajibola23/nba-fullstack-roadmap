# 🏀 Full Stack AI NBA Roadmap

This repo documents my journey to becoming a full stack engineer with AI capabilities — using NBA data, strategy, and game analysis as my creative and technical foundation.

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I'm Doing This

I'm doing this to level up my engineering skills, unlock job opportunities in software and AI, and build a career with resilience, creativity, and autonomy. I want to create projects that both **inspire** and **improve** the way people learn, interact with data, and see the game of basketball.

## 🧠 What I’m Building

A full-stack web application that allows users to:

- 🎥 Upload an NBA play video
- 🧠 Use AI (object detection + clustering) to analyze it
- 🗺️ View a visual breakdown as a coach-style diagram
- 📊 Explore player stats, play tendencies, and insights
- 🗣️ Learn why plays worked (or didn’t) — and what could’ve been done differently

It’s part **sports analytics**, part **AI experiment**, and part **personal development platform** for fans, coaches, and learners.

## 🧠 AI + NBA = Endless Possibilities

- Automatically tag pick-and-rolls, isolations, or flare screens
- Learn defensive breakdowns and play counter-suggestions
- Cluster similar plays across seasons
- Build a personal assistant for NBA tape review

---

## 📈 My Goal

To use basketball as a lens for becoming a **production-grade full stack + AI engineer**, with a deep understanding of:

- Software architecture
- Clean code and tooling
- Machine learning deployment
- Data storytelling and product thinking
