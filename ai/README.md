# 🧠 AI Integration – Overview & Goals

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This AI module powers advanced NBA analysis features across web and mobile apps. Our goal is to unlock player insights, play success predictions, and recommendations using real-world NBA data.

## 🧩 Key AI Use Cases

1. **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)**

   - Group players by play style using stats (e.g. assists, rebounds, usage rate)
   - Visualize clusters in the frontend for comparison

2. **Supervised Learning**

   - Predict success/failure of an NBA play given court state (pass, shot, spacing)
   - Display likelihood of success in the UI

3. **Recommendation Systems**
   - Suggest similar players based on user interaction or preferences
   - Recommend players to watch or study based on historical patterns

## 🛠 Integration Plan

| Phase     | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 31–34 | Set up AI folder, Python backend, and FastAPI      |
| Day 35–45 | Train and connect models (clustering, prediction)  |
| Day 46–60 | Improve models, visualization, and in-app AI usage |
| Day 61+   | Add feedback loop, rating system, rec engine UX    |
