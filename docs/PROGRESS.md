## 🧠 Weekly Highlights

- **Week 1:** Fully configured ESLint + Prettier with proper Git workflows. Built a static NBA leaderboard and connected it to a real backend API.
- **Week 2:** Will add database persistence, seed NBA data, and begin laying the groundwork for AI-driven analysis.
- **Week 2:** Replaced hardcoded player data with a real SQLite database, queried player stats with SQL, and learned backend persistence best practices.
