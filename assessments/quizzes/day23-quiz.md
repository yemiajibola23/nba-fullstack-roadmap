- B. It allows multiple components to share and modify the same data

- B. A component that only renders one very specific route
- C. A styled input form used in multiple places
- D. A config file used in build scripts

- B. A fully formed player object with `name` and `points`
- C. A fetch request

**âœ… Correct Answer:** B

**ðŸ’¬ Explanation:** `PlayerForm` creates a `{ name, points }` object and passes it to the `onAdd` callback.
