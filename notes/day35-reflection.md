**Date:** May 28, 2025

### 1. What was the most challenging part of todayâ€™s work?

The most challenging part was debugging issues related to the Text tag on screen. It took some digging to trace the warning back to a subtle JSX syntax error.

---

### 2. What concept or tool did you feel most confident using today?

I felt confident in my understanding of fetching the players from the backend onto mobile. Connecting the frontend to the Express API felt familiar and straightforward.

### 3. What part of todayâ€™s mobile setup might you reuse in future projects?

I could see myself using React Native in other projects in the future. The FlatList and navigation patterns are transferable and efficient.

### 4. Did anything surprise you, frustrate you, or teach you something unexpected?

I was surprised by how intuitive Expo was to use. It was a breeze loading the app in the iOS simulator compared to past native setups.

### 5. Anything you'd like to revisit or clean up later (e.g. tech debt)?

I don't think so.
