# 📝 Day 33 Reflection – Node ↔ FastAPI Integration

Today I successfully connected my Node.js backend to the Python-based FastAPI service. This marks a big step forward in integrating AI features into my full stack app.

### What I Accomplished
- Created a new Express route (`/cluster`) using the MVC pattern
- Wrote a controller that makes async `fetch` requests to the FastAPI server
- Handled status codes, JSON parsing, and relayed errors gracefully
- Used Postman to simulate real-world AI requests with sample player data
- Validated both success and error cases end-to-end

### What I Learned
- How to safely call async external APIs from Node.js
- The importance of checking content-type before parsing responses
- FastAPI’s validation error structure and 422 errors
- How to trace issues through both backend logs and Postman responses

### What’s Next
- Define and standardize the expected input/output format for AI APIs
- Possibly wire up a frontend trigger for testing `/cluster`
- Get ready to scale this architecture to include real clustering logic

✅ Overall, today’s work sets the foundation for advanced AI-powered features that will soon be triggered from both the frontend and mobile app.
