### 1. What was the most challenging part of today’s work?

The most challenging part of today was debugging the test failures and having to switch between a bunch of different files. The one downside to modularized code 😅

---

### 2. What was the most satisfying part?

The most satisfying part was knowing that we were making our tests more dependable, decoupling code, and making our code more scalable, maintainable and testable.

### 3. What concept(s) do you feel more confident in now?

I feel more confident about dependency injection in Javascript. I learned a lot about functions in javascript too.

### 4. Was anything unexpected or surprising today?

There were times when I was frustrated and confused by some of the test failures. It seemed like they were pointing to one issue but it was an underlying problem that was the real issue.

### 5. Is there anything you’d still like to revisit or reinforce?

We got them all down in tech debt. DI is the way to go for testing from now on.
