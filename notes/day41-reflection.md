# üèÄ Day 41 Reflection ‚Äì Full Stack AI NBA Project

**Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Focus:** Balldontlie API Integration and Seeding Real Players

---

## ‚úÖ What We Did

- Normalized and created new `teams` and `nba_players` database tables.
- Modularized the schema into separate files (`teams.js`, `nba_players.js`).
- Wrote and ran a CLI script (`seedPlayers.cjs`) to:
  - Fetch team and player data from the Balldontlie API.
  - Seed team info with proper foreign keys.
  - Seed 100 NBA players with full metadata (draft info, college, etc.).
- Resolved environment and syntax errors in SQL, CommonJS, and ESM handling.

## üß† Reflection Answers

**1. What was the most challenging part of today‚Äôs work?**  
Balancing the different files that had SQL. Every time I thought I knew where to look, things would change on me.

**2. What was the most satisfying or fun part of the day?**  
Seeing the tables populate with correct data.

**3. What concept or tool do you feel more confident about now?**  
I feel more confident about working with SQL, but I may just have scratched the surface there.

**4. Was anything surprising or confusing today?**  
The issue with the ESM scope. I felt like it popped up out of nowhere.

**5. Is there anything you'd like to revisit, polish, or deepen later?**  
Nothing that we don't already have planned so far.
