# ðŸªž Day 20 Reflection â€“ Milestone Assessment + Tech Debt

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Topic:** Full Stack Checkpoint â€“ Assessment + Tech Debt Cleanup

---

## âœ… What I Did Today

- Prevented duplicate player submissions on the **backend** by adding a `playerExists()` function to query by name.
- Cleaned up the **frontend leaderboard** by filtering out duplicate player names before rendering.
- Manually tested deduplication behavior via direct database insert and `curl` calls.
- Completed a **15-question milestone assessment** covering:
  - React fundamentals (`useState`, `useEffect`, `Context`)
  - Backend structure (routes, controllers, models)
  - Express route syntax and error handling
  - API interaction and debugging practices
  - Jest testing with Supertest
- Scored **15/15** on the quiz ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ¤” What I Learned

- How to guard against data duplication on both frontend and backend, using case-insensitive logic and clean filtering.
- Why modular backend architecture matters â€” better separation = easier debugging and testing.
- Revisited core React concepts and felt confident applying them to production-like scenarios.
- Writing concise but complete answers in a mixed-format quiz helps reinforce knowledge.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™ll Improve or Do Next

- Begin work on the **Player Insights Panel** and prepare to enrich the UI with expandable data views.
- Add automated test cases for deduplication logic.
- Explore improving form validation feedback on the frontend.
- Look for more opportunities to tackle tech debt or deferred enhancements from `TECH_DEBT.md`.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaway

Today felt like a checkpoint and confidence boost. Hitting 15/15 while cleaning up real issues shows Iâ€™m building strong habits â€” not just rushing features. Iâ€™m starting to think more like an engineer and architect.
