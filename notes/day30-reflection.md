# 🏀 Day 30 – Reflection

### ✅ What I Did

- Completed an extended 15-question assessment covering:
  - bcrypt password hashing
  - session-based authentication
  - cookie configuration
  - auth middleware and route protection
- Scored 12/15 on the quiz, with correct answers on route security, session usage, and async logic
- Previewed the AI integration roadmap:
  - Setup steps for a Python FastAPI backend
  - High-level plan for clustering and play prediction AI modules
  - Node ↔ Python architecture sketch and planned data formats

---

### 💡 What I Learned

- How `express-session` uses cookies to persist login across routes
- Importance of `httpOnly` and `secure` flags for session cookies
- The correct flow of setting session state after login
- Session middleware timing issues and how to debug 401s

---

### 🧠 Highlights

- Practiced real-world debugging of session auth edge cases
- First structured exposure to how AI will plug into the stack
- Confident about bridging backend and AI logic next

---

### 🔧 Next Steps

- Scaffold `ai/` folder and Python backend in Day 31
- Install FastAPI and create the first dummy endpoint
- Link FastAPI with the Node.js server
