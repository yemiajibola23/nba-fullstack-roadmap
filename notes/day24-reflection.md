# 🪞 Day 24 Reflection – Charting with Recharts + Tailwind

**Date:** May 21, 2025  
**Topic:** Charting with Recharts + Tailwind CSS  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Quiz Score:** 3/5

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

- Successfully installed and configured **Tailwind CSS** in my Vite + React project.
- Learned about Tailwind’s utility-first styling approach and integrated it into my layout.
- Installed and used **Recharts** to visualize player data from global context.
- Built a reusable `ChartPanel` component that renders a bar chart of player points.
- Refactored my player rendering logic into a clean `LeaderboardList` component.
- Used `usePlayerContext()` to keep components decoupled and state-driven.

---

## 🤔 What I Struggled With

- Encountered a tricky install issue with Tailwind’s CLI not resolving properly via `npx`.
- Accidentally tried to use `PlayerContext` directly instead of the custom hook.
- Misread one Tailwind utility’s purpose in the quiz (layout vs. grid columns).

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- Tailwind’s `@tailwind base/components/utilities` directives must be placed in a proper `.css` file and integrated through PostCSS.
- `ResponsiveContainer` is **crucial** when working with Recharts — without it, charts collapse.
- Creating **custom context hooks** (`usePlayerContext`) greatly simplifies component code and improves reusability.
- Tailwind’s `max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4` combo is great for centering and padding structured UIs.

## 🚀 What's Next

- Move into more advanced layout refinements and conditional UI rendering.
- Prep for Day 25: **React recap quiz + frontend reflection**
- Consider adding hover styles or mobile responsiveness improvements as tech debt.

## 🔁 Integration Notes

- ✅ ChartPanel pulls from shared state and updates automatically when players change.
- ✅ Layout is responsive and uses Tailwind grid + spacing conventions.
- ✅ All commits were clean and modular.
