# ðŸªž Day 25 Reflection â€“ React Frontend Recap + Assessment

ðŸ“… **Date:** May 21, 2025

## âœ… What I Built

Today marked a reflective milestone in my Full Stack AI NBA journey. I completed a **cumulative frontend assessment** covering Days 21â€“24, which spanned advanced frontend topics including:

- React Context for global state
- Modular and reusable component architecture
- SQL JOINs and team/player data models
- Charting with Recharts (bar/line visualization)

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- **React Context** is powerful for managing state across deeply nested components without prop drilling.
- I solidified my understanding of **`useEffect`** and when to use it for data fetching.
- I got hands-on experience with **Recharts**, visualizing player data in a user-friendly format.
- I understood the purpose of **optimistic UI updates** and how they improve user experience.
- The backend schema using **SQLite JOINs and foreign keys** helped tie everything together.

## ðŸ“‰ What Could Be Improved

- I missed a question on **context consumption** â€” I answered with incorrect syntax for `useContext`.
- I also misunderstood the expected **data shape for charts**, which led to an incorrect answer.
- In the future, I should pay closer attention to **exact data formats** expected by libraries like Recharts.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts That Stuck

- Component modularization makes React apps cleaner and easier to scale.
- Maintaining global state in a Provider component is key to clean data flow.
- Recharts expects data in a specific object array structure: `[{{ name: \"LeBron\", points: 30 }}, ...]`

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Begin building user authentication system (Day 26)
- Apply what I've learned to guard routes and manage user sessions
- Carry over service-layer ideas for fetch abstraction
