# 🏀 Day 34 Reflection – AI Input/Output Schema + Validator

**Date:** May 27, 2025

### ✅ What I Accomplished

Today I focused on designing and formalizing the data pipeline between my Node.js backend and FastAPI AI service. I:

- Updated the `Player` model in FastAPI to include new clustering-relevant fields: `steals`, `blocks`, `turnovers`, `field_goal_pct`, `three_point_pct`, and `minutes_played`.
- Created `player_input_schema.json` to define the exact structure for valid AI clustering input.
- Built a realistic `sample_input.json` file with varied player types.
- Defined the expected response format via `player_output_schema.json` and added a `sample_output.json`.
- Wrote a Python script using `jsonschema` to validate input files from the command line.
- Installed and documented `jsonschema` in `requirements.txt`.

### 🤔 What I Learned

- The importance of **clean data contracts** when integrating between systems — especially in a hybrid backend/ML architecture.
- How to create and use **JSON Schemas** to define expected inputs and catch errors early.
- That **automated validation tools** like `jsonschema` help create repeatable, testable workflows even for data formats.
- Realized how clustering models rely heavily on well-structured numerical features — and that non-numeric or identifier fields (like `name`) can introduce noise if misused.

### 🧠 Next Steps

- Create a test clustering route in FastAPI that uses this input/output structure.
- Eventually add schema validation directly into the backend route for safety.
- Consider automating schema validation inside the CI/CD pipeline.
- Explore schema inference or dynamic generation for larger models later.

### 💬 One Sentence Summary

I created the foundation for my AI pipeline with clean input/output schemas, sample data, and a validator script — bringing structure and safety to my AI integration.
