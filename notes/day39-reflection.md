# 📝 Day 39 Reflection – Mobile Testing + Styling

**1. What was the most challenging part of today’s work?**  
The most challenging part of today's work was debugging the logic to show the loading and empty states. I incorrectly put that logic in the PlayerListView instead of the Leaderboard.

The most satisfying part was seeing the stylized cards come together.

**3. How do you feel about your grasp of mobile UI state handling after today?**  
I feel I understand state handling fairly well.

**4. Was there anything that surprised you while working on loading or empty state logic?**  
The surprising part was the fact that I originally wasn't putting the loading and empty states in the right place.

I would eventually like to add more detail to the player cards like player photos and other stats.
