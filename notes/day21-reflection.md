# ðŸ“… Day 21 Reflection â€“ May 20, 2025

## What I Worked On

- Implemented a toggleable insights panel for each player in the leaderboard.
- Used `useState` to manage visibility state for the insights section.
- Displayed mock data (assists, rebounds, team) with conditional rendering.
- Extracted the insights UI into a reusable `PlayerInsights` component.
- Styled the insights panel using plain CSS (Tailwind coming soon).

## What I Learned

- How to use `useState` for toggling UI components.
- Benefits of component modularization for reuse and clarity.
- Conditional rendering best practices in React.
- How undefined props behave in React components.
- The importance of visual clarity through simple UI polish.

## Challenges

- Deciding whether to style with Tailwind or plain CSS today.
- Remembering how React handles undefined props in the render flow.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate best time in the curriculum to introduce TailwindCSS.
- Consider fetching dynamic insights from backend or AI layer later.
- Build on this component with future interactivity or stat visualizations.

## Overall Reflection

This was a smooth and productive day. The insights panel enhances the UX and sets the stage for AI-generated content. Extracting the component was a good decision for future reusability. Tailwind integration will further improve dev speed and styling flexibility.
