**Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Topic:** Component Refactoring and Reuse

---

### ✅ What I Accomplished

- Refactored `PlayerCard`, `PlayerForm`, and `Leaderboard` into separate component files
- Updated import paths and wiring for props like `onAdd` and `onDelete`
- Confirmed all components render correctly with shared state from context
- Practiced prop design, modularization, and state flow across components

---

### 🤔 What I Learned

- How to structure React components for reuse and maintainability
- The importance of clean prop APIs for flexibility and clarity
- Best practices for pagination and deduplication logic
- When and why to lift state or abstract logic into a hook

---

### 🛠️ What I’ll Improve or Explore Next

- Consider refactoring pagination logic into a reusable hook
- Add prop validation using `PropTypes` or migrate to TypeScript later
- Explore visual enhancements like loading skeletons and micro-interactions

### 💬 Takeaway

Modularization isn’t just about file organization — it’s about building composable, testable, and scalable systems. Each refactor made the app easier to reason about and extend.
