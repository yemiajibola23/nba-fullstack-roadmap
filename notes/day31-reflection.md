# ðŸ§  Day 31 Reflection â€“ AI Integration Kickoff

## âœ… What I Did

- Defined the purpose and goals of the AI module for the NBA app.
- Created a clear folder structure under `/ai/` including `data/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, and more.
- Set up a Python virtual environment using `venv`.
- Installed core ML dependencies like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `jupyter`.
- Verified setup with a simple KMeans clustering notebook using fake player stats.

## ðŸ¤” What I Learned

- How to isolate Python dependencies with `venv` for project-specific environments.
- The importance of a well-organized AI folder layout for collaboration and scalability.
- How to bootstrap an ML notebook and test unsupervised clustering logic.
- Best practices for Markdown formatting to prevent broken rendering in editors like Notion or GitHub.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Reinforced

- Unsupervised learning (KMeans)
- Markdown syntax quirks (especially with code blocks)
- Python environment setup
- Git hygiene with project structure and requirements.txt

## ðŸš§ What's Next

- Build a FastAPI server to expose ML endpoints.
- Begin planning the real NBA dataset and features needed for clustering.
- Integrate Python ML service with Node backend for full-stack AI handoff.
