# 🏀 Day 32 Reflection – FastAPI Integration Kickoff

## ✅ What I Accomplished
- Set up a modular FastAPI backend inside the `/ai/server` directory
- Created a `/healthcheck` endpoint to confirm server status
- Built a `/cluster` route stub using `APIRouter`
- Defined schema validation using Pydantic models (`Player`, `ClusterRequest`)
- Successfully sent and validated real POST requests using Swagger docs

## 🧠 What I Learned
- FastAPI is excellent for building lightweight, async-ready REST APIs in Python
- `APIRouter` enables clean separation of routes and promotes scalable architecture
- Pydantic models handle validation automatically, reducing manual checks
- Swagger UI is incredibly helpful for testing and documenting endpoints

## 🤔 Questions or Follow-ups
- How do we handle large payloads or real-time AI tasks from Node to FastAPI?
- When should we use background tasks or queues in FastAPI for long-running jobs?

## 🔁 What's Next
- Connect this Python backend to the Node.js app using async fetch
- Begin clustering real player data using the stubbed `/cluster` route
- Plan the AI response format for downstream use in the UI
